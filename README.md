# Laravel Refactoring Kata Test

## Introduction

**SAYNA** is present in plenty of countries, and we have some message templates we want to send
in different languages. To achieve that, we've developed `TemplateManager` whose job is to replace
placeholders in texts by travel related information.

`TemplateManager` is a class that's been around for years and nobody really knows who coded
it, or how it really works. Nonetheless, as the business changes frequently, this class has
already been modified many times, making it harder to understand at each step.

Today, once again, the PO wants to add some new stuff to it.
But this class is already complex enough, and just adding a new behavior will break the app.

Your mission, should you accept it, is to **refactor `TemplateManager` to make it
understandable by the next developers** and easy to change afterward. Now is the time for you to
show your exceptional abilities and improve this implementation, extensible, and ready for the future
features. Of course, **you have to port all the code to Laravel**.

This exercise **was made to not last longer than 4 hours**, but we know that this can be too short to do it all, and you might take longer if it pleases you. Stop when you feel you've done something you feel comfortable sharing with us. Your task is not to make ALL the application on Laravel, we only want you to show off your skills. But keep in mind that your test result will give you your payment level at the end, and that you cannot change that if you screw up the test.

You can run the example file to see the method in action.

## Rules

 - You must commit regularly

## Deliverables
What do we expect from you:
