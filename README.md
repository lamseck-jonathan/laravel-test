# Laravel Refactoring Kata Test

## Description

Coding refactor challenge

## Task

Refactoring the TemplateManager Class without actually changing its current behavior.

## Installation 

```bash
composer install 
```

## Running the test 

```bash
make example 
```

## What are the principles we followed in this process

to make this TemplateManager more readable we refactor this code , so we can use some clean code principles
-  function with descriptive names
-  function that do one thing
-  writing the code to make it clear enough so you don't really need to add comments 

## Hope you enjoy it :)
